    <td><i>'When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind'<br> <br>- Dr. Wayne W. Dyer</i></td>
    <td>Letting go is sometimes necessary, even if you know you're right, and it's fair to do to another as they've done to you - sometimes being kind is the better option, even if you're not doing what's considered fair or right.</td>

    <td>October</td>
    <td>'Your deeds are your monuments<br><br><i>-inscription on an Egyptian tomb</i></td>
    <td>What you do, your acts of kindness, your contribution to society, is your legacy which is on display as is a statue - representing the kind of person you are, a legacy which lasts for decades. You will die without any posessions, but be remembered for your deeds.</td>

    <td>December</td>
    <td><i>Audentes fortuna iuvat</i> <b>(fortune favours the bold)</b> <br><br><i>- Virgil</i></td>
    <td>You have to be bold in order to be 'lucky'. To be successful means to take risks, to be willing to fail.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>June</td>
    <td>'Just follow the day and reach for the sun'<br><br><i>- The Polyphonic Spree</i></td>
    <td>Follow through on your dreams, even through the toughest of days, in order to make your dream a reality. Just go with the flow, and make the best of adversities because those challenges make the dream even more rewarding once accomplished.</td>
