<p>Dear readers,<br> <br>I've recently read the book 'Wonder' by R. J. Palacio, a book documenting the life of Auggie Pullman, a kid born with a genetic disease that altered the look of his face, resulting in a multitude of surgeries which still did not fix the appearance of his face. 'Wonder' is full of many life lessons that we can all inculcate in our lives. The idea of sensitivity, kindness, patience, selflessness and tolerance are all very prevalent and very important. But the idea I would like to focus on is the idea of perspective.<br>

<br>Things like kindness and sensitivity are important traits, very commonly acknowledged, but the idea of perspective is as important, if not more important and it and goes hand in hand with kindness, sensitivity and tolerance, as well as a whole bunch of other important characteristics. Perspective is the ability to see all sides of the picture, to understand and acknowledge the other factors that contributed to the outcome or one's behaviour and to look past what meets the eye. <br>

<br>In 'Wonder', Auggie is born with 'mandibulofacial dysostosis', which alters the appearance of his face, and he's forced to have surgeries to help, missing years of school in the process. Auggie's parents spend almost every available second with Auggie - taking him to doctors, therapists, even homeschooling him. Auggie eventually starts school, and that in addition comes with its ups and downs. Auggie is having a real hard time, but he isn't the only one. <br>

<br>Auggie's sister Olivia, or Via for short, can't remember life without Auggie. Her earliest memories are of her and her brother: Auggie arriving home from the hospital, playing together at home and even being with Auggie as he's  called names behind his back. But a big part of her childhood memories of him are of her parents fussing over him and spending most of their time looking after him. Via used to speak to her gran about everything, as she felt her problems weren't important enough for her parents to listen to compared to her brother's, and as a result they form a special bond. Her gran eventually dies and Via feels lonely, unable to express her true feelings. Via knows how hard life is for Auggie, but has feelings of her own and feels upset that she doesn't get any attention and is left to deal with her problems on her own. <br>
<br>Via then becomes a freshman at school, and Auggie starts school as well. Although Via is having a hard time adjusting, she feels she can't speak to her parents about this. After the summer break, her (old) friends Miranda and Ella don't interact much with her, as they chose to hang out with the popular kids instead. Via doesn't realise that the reason Miranda isn't speaking to her is because she is embarrassed. Embarrassed that she told a bunch of kids at her summer-camp about 'her' special needs brother who she has to support, about 'her' wealthy family in North River Heights, while the reality was that she was struggling financially and her family was in a bad state. <br>

<br>Auggie is busy worrying about making friends and trying to fit in while looking abnormal, but doesn't realise the parallel reality that exists for Via. Via is struggling socially, as well as feeling neglected by her parents. Via feels disappointed with Miranda who she thinks doesn't like her anymore, but Miranda's perspective is that she is dishonest and jealous of Via and regrets telling everyone about her special needs brother. There are many more examples of the concept of perspective throughout the book. Perspective is a important aspect of everyday life, it shows there's more than one side to a story, there's a reason why something happened, a reason why someone thought a way they did, or did what they did. We can't always see the big picture, or the minor stuff that can make up a huge part of the story. We often need to just step back, and take a look at the big picture, and to examine the little facts as well. We won't always know everything that contributes to the outcome, or know what goes on behind the scenes. But we can adjust our reaction and give people the benefit of the doubt, because you never know what people are really going through.
